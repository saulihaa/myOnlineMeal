1) Process I followed to build this website:
Firstly,I Used a responsive flex layout  to create a clean and simple design for the home page.Included a header with the business name and a navigation menu.Used cards or icons to display the services or products offered by the business.Included a section to introduce the business clients.Then I used a footer to include information. Next, I created a contact us page using HTML form elements such as input fields and a submit button. Then used JavaScript to validate the form fields.Used a responsive design to ensure that the form and the whole website look perfect on all devices especially mobile devices.Atlast I made a use of CSS media queries to adjust the layout and typography for different screen sizes.
Used browser developer tools to test the website on different devices and screen sizes and make any necessary adjustments.


2)The programming languages I used to build this website include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3) To ensure that a website is responsive and mobile-friendly, a technique I used during the development process is using a responsive web design (RWD) approach: This involves using CSS media queries to change the layout and styling of the website based on the screen size and resolution of the device it is being viewed on. This allows the website to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, making it more user-friendly for mobile devices.

4)No, I didn’t face any challenges during the development process.

5) Examples of how I used responsive design techniques to make the website look and function correctly on different devices and screen sizes are:

•Flexible grid layout: Using a flexible grid layout allows the website to automatically adjust its layout to fit the screen size of the device it is being viewed on. This can be achieved by using CSS grid or flexbox to create a flexible grid system, where the columns and rows will adjust their width and height based on the screen size.

•Media queries: Media queries are used to apply different CSS styles based on the screen size and resolution of the device. For example, you can use media queries to hide or show certain elements on the website, or to change the font size, when the screen width is smaller than a certain value.

•Text and font size: Using relative units, such as em or rem, for text and font size allows the text to be resized automatically based on the user's device settings, making it more easily readable on different devices.

•Touch-friendly buttons and links: To ensure that the website is easy to use on touch devices, buttons and links should be large enough to be easily tapped and should have enough spacing between them to prevent accidental clicks. Additionally, links should be placed within easy reach of the user's thumb and fingers.

6) Sure, here are a few best practices and lessons learned that I would recommend following during the development process:

1.Keep it simple: Simplicity is key when it comes to website design and development. Avoid cluttering the website with unnecessary elements and focus on creating a clean and easy-to-use interface.

2.Prioritize mobile devices: With an increasing number of people accessing the internet on mobile devices, it's important to prioritize the mobile experience. This can be done by using a mobile-first design approach and testing the website on different devices to ensure it looks and works as expected.

3.Test, test, test: Testing the website on different devices and screen sizes is crucial to ensure that it looks and works as expected. This can be done manually or by using tools that simulate different device types and screen sizes.

These are just a few examples of best practices and lessons learned that I would recommend following during the development process. Keep in mind that as your business and your audience needs grow, you'll have to adapt your website accordingly.
